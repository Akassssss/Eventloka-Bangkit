The Event Marketplace Application is designed to connect event initiators with event organizers through a convenient marketplace platform. It aims to streamline the event planning process by providing a central hub where users can list events, find suitable organizers, and manage event details efficiently.

## Features

- Marketplace for Event Organizers: Event initiators can list their event plans, allowing event organizers to browse and apply for events they are interested in managing
- Algorithm-Based Matching: Includes a "Find EO" feature utilizing an algorithm to match event initiators with the most suitable event organizers based on specified criteria.
- Rating System: Users can rate and review event organizers, providing valuable feedback to ensure quality service.

- Dual-Side Acceptance: Implements a feature where both parties (event initiators and organizers) must agree to collaborate before finalizing an event arrangement.

- Profile Management: Users can edit and manage their profiles, including updating contact information, skills, and preferences.






## Future Development

- Payment Gateway Integration: Implementing secure payment processing within the platform for seamless financial transactions.

- In-App Messaging: Adding a chat feature to facilitate direct communication between event initiators and organizers, enhancing collaboration and coordination.
